<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm <b>Vaibhav Giradkar</b>, a passionate and driven student currently pursuing a degree 
  in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Priyadarshini College of Engineering,
  graduating in 2025. I am a tech enthusiast with a special interest in web development,
  IoT innovations, and emerging technologies that solve real-world problems.<br><br>

During my academic journey, I've actively engaged in both technical and creative pursuits.
 One of my key contributions includes working on the project "IoT-Based Railway Track Crack 
 Detection & Obstacle Detection System", a smart solution aimed at enhancing railway safety
  using sensor-based real-time detection. This project was developed in collaboration with
  my peers—Abhas Pal, Sarthak Nikose, Vedant Ankar, and Vipul Gedam—under the guidance of 
  Dr. M. K. Demde.
  <br><br>
My professional experience includes an internship at YugAlpha Tech Pvt. Ltd., where I honed my 
web development skills by building dynamic and user-friendly websites. Notable projects include
a restaurant web page and a personal portfolio website, both reflecting my ability to combine
aesthetic design with functional code.<br><br>

I believe in continuous learning, problem-solving, and staying updated with the latest in tech.
Whether it's exploring full-stack development, diving into IoT systems, or managing real-world
projects, I bring dedication, creativity, and a growth mindset to everything I do.
